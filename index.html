OPERATING SYSTEMS LABORATORY
OBJECTIVE:
This lab complements the operating systems course. Students will gain practical experience with designing 
and implementing concepts of operating systems such as system calls, CPU scheduling, process 
management, memory management, file systems and deadlock handling using C language in Linux 
environment.
OUTCOMES:
Upon the completion</h1>
